<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
We Microsoft Research Asia made submissions to 11 language directions in the WMT19 news  translation tasks. We won the first place for 8 of the 11 directions and the  second place for the other three. Our basic systems are built on Transformer, back  translation and knowledge distillation. We integrate several of our rececent techniques to enhancethe baseline systems: multi-agent dual learning (MADL),  masked  sequence-to-sequencepre-training (MASS), neural architecture optimization (NAO), and soft contextual data augmentation (SCA).
