<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
The  performance  of  translation  system  and  corpus  size  is  inseparable,  corpus 
quality has also a direct impact on the final translation result. Thus, auto tagging and 
stemming as fundamental work in creating a corpus is of great significance.  

Uyghur  automatic  stemming  and  POS  tagging  is  indispensable  part  of  Uyghur 
NLP as above, in order to increase the translate quality of based on statistical Moses 
Uyghur  Chinese  bilateral  machine  translation,  have  to  expend  the  Uyghur  Chinese 
parallel corpus size then added both tagging and stemming to machine translation data 
set.  From  the  research  of  Uyghur  POS  tagging  and  stemming  beginning  till  now 
different people use variety methods to achieve, but the result is not good. In this paper, 
references the stemming algorithms based on Morfessor and POS tagging method based 
on conditional random fields (CRF) respectively. 

Explained  the  principles  of  CRF,  Morfessor  and  doing  experiments  in  order  to 
collect corpus to research, developed an online data collecting tool of Uyghur, Kazak, 
Kirghiz based on WEB, achieved 90% text corpus via this in paper. 

Because of CRF and Morfessor has strict requirements to the format of data set, 
developed  two  pre-processing  softwares.  Changed  CRF  template  file  and  do  many 
experiments on LINUX, achieved tagging model and called this developed automatic 
tagging system. In Morfessor can only trained the best segmentation model via doing 
experiment on huge corpus, called this model developed automatic stemming system.

Finally, test result showed that for Uyghur POS tagging precision reached 89.73%, 
automatic segmentation precision achieved 86.80%. Based on research results above, 
the BLEU score was increased from former score 23.42 to current score 25.38 of the 
Uyghur Chinese bidirectional statistical machine translation based on MOSES.
