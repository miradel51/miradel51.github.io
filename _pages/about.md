Biography
---------

Dr. Maimaiti Mieradilijiang is a Senior Algorithm Engineer for Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the [Language Technology Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/language-technology) in [ALIBABA DAMO ACADEMY](https://damo.alibaba.com/). 
Previously, Mieradilijiang received his Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) at [Tsinghua University (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. MaoSong Sun](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/staff/sms/) and is also co-supervised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/) in the [THUNLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
His work is in NLP, machine translation (MT), and machine learning (ML).
Mieradilijiang is engaged in some work related to MT since September 2016. He is working on neural machine translation (NMT) between low-resource languages (LRLs) and morphologically rich languages (MRLs), including some minority languages. He also studied the domain adaptation problem for NMT and explored transfer learning (TL) and data augmentation (DA) for LRLs in NMT. At the same time, he focused on morphological analysis in agglutinated and inflected languages.

Before joining [THUNLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), he obtained his master's and bachelor's degrees from the [School of Information Science and Engineering](http://it.xju.edu.cn/) at [Xinjiang University (XJU)](https://www.xju.edu.cn/), majoring in software engineering and computer science, respectively. During his master's degree, he worked on computational morphology, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and morphological analysis under the guidance of an academician [Prof. Wushouer Silamu](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/3943/index.html). During his undergraduate studies, he developed several desktop applications at [XJU](https://www.xju.edu.cn/), such as educational software, medical applications, several network applications (corporate and official government websites), and some valuable APPs for Android and Windows Phone (WP) before coming to [THU](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Therefore, Mieradilijiang gained some experience in software development for desktop, network, and smart mobile devices before his Ph.D.

In addition, he is very interested in solving some NLP problems using ML and DL. Currently, he is also still exploring some interesting methods for natural language generation (NLG) (e.g., MT or machine writing) and natural language understanding (NLU) (e.g., reasoning or semantic retrieval).
