About me
------

I am a Ph.D. in [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My mentor is [Prof. MaoSong Sun](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/staff/sms/). I am also advised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/). 
My research interests are NLP, Machine Translation (MT), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I have been exploring some works related to MT under the guidance of [Prof. Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/) since September 2016.  I am working on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) between both Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) and Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs), and include some minority languages.  Meanwhile, I have been investigating some tasks about the "Domain Adaptation (DA) Problem for NMT"  approximately for more than one year.  Currently, I am focusing on Transfer Learning (TL) and the text generation field. The latest work what I am doing is about data augmentation for LRLs in NMT.

In my master, I had also worked on computational morphology,  speech recognition, speech synthesis, and morphological analysis in both agglutinated and inflected languages under the guidance of Engineering Academician [Prof. Wushouer Silamu](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/3943/index.html). When I was a bachelor I also developed some desktop applications, as well as educational software and medical applications, several network applications (company websites and official government websites), and some useful APPs for Android and Windows Phone (WP) at [Xinjiang University (XJU)](https://www.xju.edu.cn/) before coming to [THU](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Therefore, I had collected some experiences about software development for the desktop, network, and smart mobile devices before began my Ph.D. 

Moreover, I am keen on addressing some NLP problems by exploiting ML and DL approaches.  Presently, I spend more and more time on NLP tasks mainly on some interesting and meaningful problems for NMT.
