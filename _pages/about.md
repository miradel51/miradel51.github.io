Biography
---------

Dr. Mieradilijiang Maimaiti is currently an Assistant Professor (Tenure-Track) at the [School of Computer Science](http://it.xju.edu.cn/), [Xinjiang University (XJU)](https://english.xju.edu.cn/). <!-- Research Assistant of the [Laboratory of Multilingual Information Technology](http://www.xjipc.cas.cn/XJMITL/) in [Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.xjipc.cas.cn/). -->
Before that, he worked as Senior Algorithm Engineer for Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the [Language Technology Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/language-technology) in [ALIBABA DAMO ACADEMY](https://damo.alibaba.com/). 
Previously, Mieradilijiang received his Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) at [Tsinghua University (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Maosong Sun](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/staff/sms/) and is also co-advised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/) in the [THUNLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
His work focuses on NLP, machine translation (MT), and machine learning (ML). Mieradilijiang has been involved in MT-related work since September 2016, specifically concentrating on neural machine translation (NMT) involving low-resource languages (LRLs) and morphologically rich languages (MRLs), which include minority languages. Additionally, he has researched the domain adaptation problem in NMT and delved into transfer learning and data augmentation for LRLs in NMT. Concurrently, he has dedicated attention to morphological analysis in agglutinated and inflected languages.
<!-- His work is in NLP, machine translation (MT), and machine learning (ML).
Mieradilijiang is engaged in some work related to MT since September 2016. He is working on neural machine translation (NMT) between low-resource languages (LRLs) and morphologically rich languages (MRLs), including some minority languages. He also studied the domain adaptation problem for NMT and explored transfer learning (TL) and data augmentation (DA) for LRLs in NMT. At the same time, he focused on morphological analysis in agglutinated and inflected languages.-->

<!-- Before joining THUNLP Lab, he obtained his master's and bachelor's degrees from the School of Information Science and Engineering at Xinjiang University (XJU), majoring in software engineering and computer science, respectively. During his master's degree, he worked on computational morphology, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and morphological analysis under the guidance of an academician Prof. Wushouer Silamu. During his undergraduate studies, he developed several desktop applications, such as educational software, medical applications, several network applications (corporate and official government websites), and some valuable APPs for Android and Windows Phone (WP). Mieradilijiang gained experience in software development for desktop, network, and smart mobile devices before pursuing his Ph.D -->

Mieradilijiang gained experience in software development for desktop, network, and smart mobile devices before pursuing his Ph.D.

<!-- In addition, he is very interested in solving some NLP problems using ML and DL. Currently, he is also still exploring some interesting methods for natural language generation (NLG) (e.g., MT or machine writing) and natural language understanding (NLU) (e.g., reasoning or semantic retrieval). -->
Furthermore, he possesses a keen interest in leveraging ML to address various NLP issues. Presently, he continues to explore intriguing methodologies for Natural Language Generation, such as Machine Translation or automated content creation, and for Natural Language Understanding, including reasoning and semantic retrieval.

<strong>Nothing is impossible!</strong>
