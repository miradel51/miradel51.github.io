About me
------

I have received my Ph.D. in [Natural Language Processing (NLP) group](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My mentor is [Prof. MaoSong Sun](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/staff/sms/) and I am also advised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ly/). 
My research interests are NLP, Machine Translation (MT), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I have been exploring some works related to MT since September 2016.  I am working on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) between both Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) and Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs), and include some minority languages.  
Furthermore, I had investigated the domain adaptation problem for NMT and also explored the Transfer Learning (TL) and Data Augmentation (DA) for LRLs in NMT. Meanwhile, I am focusing on the morphological analysis in both agglutinated and inflected languages. 
Currently, I am still investigating some interesting methods for natural language generation (e.g., MT or machine writing) and natural language understanding (e.g., reasoning or semantic retrieval) as well.

In my master, I had also worked on computational morphology, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and morphological analysis under the guidance of Engineering Academician [Prof. Wushouer Silamu](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/3943/index.html). When I was a bachelor I also developed several desktop applications, such as as educational software, medical applications, several network applications (company websites and official government websites), and some useful APPs for Android and Windows Phone (WP) at [Xinjiang University (XJU)](https://www.xju.edu.cn/) before coming to [THU](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Therefore, I had collected some experiences about software development for the desktop, network, and smart mobile devices before began my Ph.D.

Moreover, I am keen on addressing some NLP problems by exploiting ML and DL approaches. Presently, I spend most of my time on NLP tasks mainly on some interesting and meaningful problems both for natural language generation and understanding.
